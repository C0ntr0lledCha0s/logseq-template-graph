# Self-Improvement Skill - Examples

This document shows real-world examples of the self-improvement skill in action, analyzing errors, optimizing documentation, and creating feedback loops.

---

## Example 1: PowerShell Emoji Corruption Analysis

### User Request
"The pre-push hook failed with a parse error. Was that caused by a Claude Code instruction? Can I make an update to improve the feedback loop?"

### Skill Activation
The self-improvement skill activates to analyze the PowerShell error and suggest improvements.

### Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Capture Error Context
```bash
# Error message
The string is missing the terminator: ".

# Location
.git-hooks/pre-push.ps1:92

# Tool used
Edit tool (Claude Code modified the file)

# What was changed
Commit ae642ba - Added error messages with emojis
```

#### Step 2: Identify Root Cause

**Category:** ENCODING

**Explanation:**
The Edit tool replaced emoji `❌` with corrupted bytes `M-bM-^]M-^L` due to character encoding issues when modifying PowerShell scripts.

**Evidence:**
```powershell
# Before (intended)
Write-Host "❌ Error message"

# After Edit tool (actual)
Write-Host "M-bM-^]M-^L Error message"  # Corrupted!
```

#### Step 3: Determine Preventability

**Preventable?** Yes

**Root Analysis:**
- Claude Code was not aware that PowerShell scripts have emoji encoding issues
- CLAUDE.md lacked guidance about PowerShell character handling
- No existing pattern documented for this issue

#### Step 4: Generate Learning

**Error Pattern Catalog Entry:**
```markdown
#### Pattern 1: PowerShell Emoji Corruption
**Error:** Emojis in `.ps1` files become garbled (`❌` → `M-bM-^]M-^L`)
**Root Cause:** Character encoding during Edit tool usage
**Solution:** Use ASCII alternatives (`[ERROR]`, `[SUCCESS]`)
**Prevention:** Add PowerShell guidelines to CLAUDE.md
**Learning:** Never use emojis in PowerShell scripts
**Commits:** ae642ba (introduced), 7e5d981 (fixed)
```

**CLAUDE.md Addition:**
```markdown
## PowerShell Script Guidelines

### Avoid Emojis in PowerShell Scripts

Emojis can become corrupted due to encoding issues, causing syntax errors.

**❌ Bad (causes errors):**
```powershell
Write-Host "❌ Error message" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "✅ Success message" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**✅ Good (ASCII-safe):**
```powershell
Write-Host "[ERROR] Error message" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "[SUCCESS] Success message" -ForegroundColor Green
```

### ASCII-Safe Alternatives

| Emoji | ASCII Alternative | Use Case |
|-------|-------------------|----------|
| ❌ | `[ERROR]` or `[X]` | Errors, failures |
| ✅ | `[SUCCESS]` or `[OK]` | Success, passed checks |
| ⚠️ | `[WARNING]` or `[!]` | Warnings, attention needed |
```

#### Step 5: Implement Improvement

**Actions Taken:**
1. ✅ Fixed `.git-hooks/pre-push.ps1` - Replaced all emojis with ASCII
2. ✅ Added PowerShell guidelines to CLAUDE.md (lines 208-276)
3. ✅ Documented pattern in self-improvement skill
4. ✅ Created ASCII alternatives table for reference

**Commit:**
```
fix(workflow): resolve PowerShell emoji corruption and add scripting guidelines

Fixed pre-push.ps1 emoji corruption and added comprehensive PowerShell
scripting guidelines to CLAUDE.md to prevent future encoding issues.
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Error resolved
- ✅ Prevention documented
- ✅ Future occurrences unlikely
- ✅ Team has clear guidance

## Action Plan

### Immediate (Not urgent yet)
- [x] Monitor CLAUDE.md growth
- [x] Document extraction plan
- [ ] Wait until 550+ lines or section >100 lines

### Next Extraction Trigger
When either occurs:
1. File reaches 550 lines
2. Any section exceeds 100 lines
3. New platform-specific content needed

Then extract Git Workflow first (largest section).

### Proactive Preparation
1. Create `.claude/guides/` folder structure
2. Draft extracted documents
3. Update CLAUDE.md with links
4. Test navigation
5. Commit extraction

## Estimated Effort
- **Git Workflow extraction:** 1 hour
- **PowerShell extraction:** 30 minutes
- **Total first extraction:** 1.5 hours

## Recommendation

**Status:** 🟡 Plan extraction, but not urgent yet

**Current:** CLAUDE.md is healthy and well-structured. At 493 lines with good organization, it's below the 600-line threshold.

**Action:** Monitor growth and plan proactive extraction when:
- Adding 50+ more lines
- Any section grows >100 lines
- Team finds navigation difficult

**Next Review:** After next major documentation addition
```

## Example 3: Repeated Quote Escaping Analysis

### User Request
(After multiple PowerShell quote escaping errors in commits 099a4a8 and b4fc136)

"Why do we keep having PowerShell quoting issues? What pattern should we document?"

### Skill Activation
Self-improvement skill analyzes recurring error pattern.

### Pattern Analysis

#### Error Frequency
```bash
git log --all --grep="PowerShell\|quote\|escap" --oneline

b4fc136 fix(workflow): resolve PowerShell quote escaping in git hooks
099a4a8 fix(workflow): rewrite post-commit.ps1 to resolve all quote issues
```

**Frequency:** 2 occurrences in 1 week
**Severity:** Major (blocks git hooks)
**Category:** SYNTAX

#### Root Cause Analysis

**Pattern:** PowerShell interprets special characters differently in single vs double quotes

**Examples of Failures:**

```powershell
# FAIL: Pipe interpreted as command separator
$pattern = "feat|fix|docs"  # PowerShell sees: $pattern = "feat" | "fix" | "docs"

# FAIL: Parentheses cause parsing errors
Write-Host "Error (details)" # PowerShell tries to execute subexpression

# FAIL: Variables not expanded in single quotes
Write-Host 'Commit: $commitMsg'  # Prints literal "$commitMsg"
```

#### Learning Extraction

**Rule:** Single quotes for literals, double quotes for variable expansion

**Pattern Catalog Entry:**
```markdown
#### Pattern 2: PowerShell Quote Escaping
**Error:** Pipes `|` and parentheses `()` cause parse errors in double-quoted strings
**Root Cause:** PowerShell interprets special characters in double quotes
**Solution:** Use single quotes for literal strings, double quotes only for variables
**Prevention:** Added string quoting rules to CLAUDE.md
**Learning:** Single quotes = literal, double quotes = interpolation
**Commits:** 099a4a8, b4fc136 (fixes)
```

**CLAUDE.md Addition:**
```markdown
### String Quoting Rules

PowerShell interprets characters differently in single vs. double quotes:

**Use single quotes for literal strings:**
```powershell
# Good - prevents PowerShell from interpreting special chars
$pattern = '^(feat|fix|docs)(\(.+\))?: .+'
Write-Host 'Expected format: type(scope): description'
```

**Use double quotes only when you need variable expansion:**
```powershell
# Good - expands $commitMsg variable
Write-Host "   $commitMsg" -ForegroundColor Yellow
```
```

#### Impact Assessment

**Before Documentation:**
- 2 errors in 1 week
- 1-2 hours debugging each
- Total: 2-4 hours lost

**After Documentation:**
- Expected: 0 future errors
- Prevention: Claude Code checks CLAUDE.md
- Savings: 10-20 hours/year

**ROI:** High - simple guideline prevents recurring errors

## Example 4: Proactive Skill Enhancement

### User Request
"The github-issues skill is great, but could it learn from past validation mistakes?"

### Skill Activation
Self-improvement skill analyzes github-issues skill for enhancement opportunities.

### Enhancement Analysis

#### Current github-issues Skill

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive validation workflow
- Relationship tracking
- Response templates

**Potential Improvements:**
1. Learn from past false positives
2. Track validation accuracy
3. Auto-update response templates
4. Build common pattern library

#### Proposed Enhancements

**1. Validation Accuracy Tracking**

Add to github-issues skill:
```markdown
## Validation Metrics (Self-Learning)

Track validation accuracy over time:

### After Each Validation
1. Record validation result (valid/invalid/duplicate)
2. Record search commands used
3. Record time to validation
4. Record confidence level

### Weekly Review
1. Check false positives (said invalid, was valid)
2. Check false negatives (said valid, was invalid)
3. Analyze search patterns that missed results
4. Update search strategy

### Pattern Library
Common search patterns that work:
- `grep -r "ClassName" source/` - Find classes
- `git log --all --grep="feature" --oneline` - Find past work
- `gh issue list --state all --search "keyword"` - Find duplicates

Common mistakes to avoid:
- Searching only current branch (use --all)
- Case-sensitive grep (use -i for class names)
- Missing closed issues (use --state all)
```

**2. Response Template Improvement**

Add learning from actual responses:
```markdown
## Response Template Evolution

### Template Performance Tracking
- Track which templates get positive feedback
- Note which templates cause confusion
- Identify missing information requests

### Auto-Update Based on Patterns
If reporters frequently ask:
- "Where is this documented?" → Add docs link to template
- "When will this be fixed?" → Add timeline section
- "Is this related to #X?" → Improve relationship detection
```

**3. Integration with self-improvement Skill**

```markdown
## Self-Improvement Integration

After each issue validation:
1. Log to `.claude/data/issue-validations.jsonl`
2. Weekly: Analyze validation patterns
3. Monthly: Update github-issues skill
4. Quarterly: Report metrics and improvements

Example log entry:
{
  "issue": 123,
  "type": "bug",
  "validation": "invalid - already fixed",
  "search_commands": ["grep -r Recipe", "git log --grep Recipe"],
  "time_spent": "5 min",
  "confidence": "high",
  "outcome": "closed with fix reference"
}
```

#### Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1:** Add metrics tracking to github-issues
2. **Phase 2:** Create weekly analysis workflow
3. **Phase 3:** Auto-generate improvement suggestions
4. **Phase 4:** Update skill based on learnings

**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Impact:** Continuously improving validation accuracy

## Example 5: Documentation Drift Detection

### User Request
"Check if CLAUDE.md has any outdated information compared to actual project state."

### Skill Activation
Self-improvement skill performs documentation drift analysis.

### Drift Analysis Process

#### Step 1: Check File References

```bash
# Files mentioned in CLAUDE.md
grep -o '\`[^`]*\.edn\`' CLAUDE.md
grep -o '\`[^`]*\.md\`' CLAUDE.md
grep -o '\`[^`]*\.sh\`' CLAUDE.md

# Check if they exist
find . -name "logseq_db_Templates.edn"
find . -name "export.sh"
```

**Result:**
✅ All referenced files exist

#### Step 2: Check Metrics Accuracy

```bash
# CLAUDE.md claims:
"632 classes"
"1,033 properties"
"15,422 lines in main template file"

# Actual:
wc -l logseq_db_Templates.edn  # Verify line count
grep -c ':user.class/' src/**/*.edn  # Count classes
grep -c ':user.property/' src/**/*.edn  # Count properties
```

**Result:**
✅ Metrics accurate (as of last update)
⚠️ Date stamp shows "November 2025" - need to update after changes

#### Step 3: Check Workflow Accuracy

**CLAUDE.md describes:**
```markdown
npm run export  # Exports → auto-splits into src/ modules
```

**Actual behavior:**
```bash
cat package.json | grep export
# "export": "node scripts/check-deps.js && ..."
```

**Result:**
✅ Workflow description matches implementation

#### Step 4: Check for New Features Not Documented

```bash
# Check recent commits for new features
git log --since="1 month ago" --grep="feat" --oneline

97ca139 feat(workflow): add github-issues management skill
dc59569 feat(workflow): add schema-research skill
...
```

**Findings:**

## Example 8: Cross-Skill Learning

### User Request
"The commit-helper and github-issues skills both analyze git history. Can they share learnings?"

### Skill Activation
Self-improvement skill analyzes cross-skill optimization opportunities.

### Cross-Skill Integration Analysis

#### Current Overlap

**commit-helper Capability:**
- Analyzes git diff
- Determines commit type
- Suggests scopes
- Validates format

**github-issues Capability:**
- Searches git history
- Finds related commits
- Checks if issue is resolved
- Maps relationships

**Overlap:**
Both search git history and analyze commits

#### Optimization Opportunity

**Shared Knowledge Base:**
`.claude/knowledge/git-patterns.md`

```markdown
# Git Patterns Knowledge Base

Shared by: commit-helper, github-issues, self-improvement

## Commit Search Patterns

### Finding Features
```bash
# Best practices learned from usage:
git log --all --grep="feature-name" --oneline
git log --all -S"ClassName" --oneline  # Code search
git log --all --since="1 month ago" --grep="^feat" --oneline
```

### Finding Fixes
```bash
git log --all --grep="^fix.*issue-keyword" --oneline
git log --all --grep="#[0-9]+" --oneline  # Find issue refs
```

### Finding Related Work
```bash
git log --all --grep="module-name" --author="developer" --oneline
git log --all --since="date" --until="date" --oneline
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Not using --all**
   - Problem: Misses commits on other branches
   - Solution: Always use --all for comprehensive search

2. **Case sensitivity**
   - Problem: Misses variations (Recipe vs recipe)
   - Solution: Use -i for case-insensitive or search both

3. **Missing closed issues**
   - Problem: Thinks feature doesn't exist
   - Solution: gh issue list --state all

## Skill-Specific Usage

### commit-helper
- Uses: Analyze recent commits for commit style patterns
- Pattern: `git log -10 --oneline` to match project style

### github-issues
- Uses: Validate if issue already resolved
- Pattern: `git log --all --grep="issue-topic" --since="6 months ago"`

### self-improvement
- Uses: Extract error patterns from fixes
- Pattern: `git log --grep="^fix.*error\|^fix.*PowerShell"`
```

#### Enhanced Integration

**commit-helper Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Integration with github-issues

When generating commit message for issue fix:
1. Check if issue number provided
2. Search related commits: git log --all --grep="#123"
3. Match commit style from related commits
4. Suggest: "fix(scope): resolve issue #123"

When issue was invalid/duplicate:
1. Suggest: "docs(issue): close #123 as duplicate of #456"
2. Or: "docs(issue): close #123 as already fixed in <commit>"
```

**github-issues Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Integration with commit-helper

When creating fix commit for valid issue:
1. Use commit-helper to generate proper message
2. Ensure format: "fix(scope): description

   Fixes #123
   Closes #123"
3. Follow project commit conventions
```

**self-improvement Enhancement:**
```markdown
## Learning from Both Skills

Track search patterns that work:
- commit-helper: Recent style analysis
- github-issues: Historical duplicate detection
- Extract: Best practices for git-patterns.md

Monitor patterns that fail:
- Add to common mistakes
- Update skill guidance
- Improve search strategies
```

#### Implementation

1. Create `.claude/knowledge/git-patterns.md`
2. Update all three skills to reference it
3. Add cross-references in SKILL.md files
4. Track improvements in self-improvement skill

**Effort:** 1 hour
**Impact:**
- Consistent git search across skills
- Shared learnings benefit all
- Reduced redundancy

These examples show how the self-improvement skill creates a continuous learning loop, improving Claude Code's performance over time through error analysis, documentation optimization, and cross-skill knowledge sharing.
