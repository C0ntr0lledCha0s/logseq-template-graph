### Health Metrics

```
/stats --health

📊 Project Health Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Module Balance: 72/100 ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Well-balanced modules (8/11):
    ✅ person (2 classes, 36 properties)
    ✅ organization (4 classes, 15 properties)
    ✅ creative-work (14 classes, 7 properties)
    ✅ place (2 classes, 9 properties)
    ✅ product (1 class, 2 properties)
    ✅ intangible (9 classes, 9 properties)
    ✅ action (1 class, 1 property)
    ✅ health (8 classes, 12 properties)

  Attention needed (3/11):
    ⚠️  event (17 classes, only 6 properties)
       → Many classes with minimal properties

    ⚠️  misc (82 classes, 58% of total)
       → BLOATED: Consider splitting into:
          - communication/ (EmailMessage, Message)
          - financial/ (Invoice, PaymentCard, Order)
          - schema-types/ (DataType, StructuredValue)
          - administrative/ (Permit, Government, etc.)

    ⚠️  base (core classes, minimal properties)
       → OK for core module

Property Reuse: 95/100 ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Common properties: 189 (18% of total)
  Shared across: 8+ modules
  Examples: name, description, identifier, url

  Most reused properties:
    - name (used by 95% of classes)
    - description (used by 87% of classes)
    - identifier (used by 65% of classes)
    - url (used by 52% of classes)

  Property utilization: Excellent ✅

Class Hierarchy: 85/100 ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Classes with parents: 601/632 (95%)
  Orphaned classes: 31 (5%)
    - Schedule (should inherit from Intangible)
    - ProductCategory (should inherit from Thing)
    - [29 more...]

  Hierarchy depth:
    Max depth: 4 levels (Thing → CreativeWork → Article → NewsArticle)
    Avg depth: 2.3 levels
    Recommendation: Good depth ✅

Build Health: 100/100 ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  All 5 variants building: ✅
  No EDN syntax errors: ✅
  No validation warnings: ✅
  No duplicate IDs: ✅
  All parent classes exist: ✅

Documentation: 90/100 ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  README.md: Up to date ✅
  QUICK_START.md: Up to date ✅
  Module READMEs: 11/11 present ✅
  Technical docs: Up to date ✅
  CLAUDE.md: Up to date ✅

  Suggested improvements:
    - Add examples for new classes (Recipe, Book)
    - Update architecture diagram with new modules
    - Document health/ module specializations

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Overall Health Score: 87/100 (Good) ✅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Recommendations:
  1. Split misc/ module into 4-5 focused modules
  2. Add parents to 31 orphaned classes
  3. Add more properties to event/ module classes
  4. Update documentation with recent examples
```

## Data Sources

The command gathers statistics from:

1. **Source Modules** - `source/*/` directories
2. **Build Artifacts** - `build/` directory
3. **Git History** - Recent commits, growth trends
4. **Validation Scripts** - Health metrics
5. **Archive** - Historical snapshots (if available)

---

## Export Options

### Export to File

```
/stats --export stats.txt

Statistics exported to: stats.txt

Use for:
  - Documentation
  - Reports
  - Historical tracking
```

### Export as JSON

```
/stats --json > stats.json

Exports machine-readable JSON:
{
  "overview": {
    "classes": 632,
    "properties": 1033,
    "lines": 15422
  },
  "modules": [...],
  "variants": [...],
  "recent": [...],
  "trends": {...},
  "health": {...}
}
```

### Export as Markdown

```
/stats --markdown > STATS.md

Creates formatted Markdown report suitable for documentation.
```

---

## Tips

- **Run regularly** - Track project health monthly
- **Before releases** - Verify metrics before tagging
- **After major changes** - Check impact on variants
- **Share with team** - Include in status reports
- **Track trends** - Export JSON for historical analysis

---

## Time Savings

**Manual Statistics Collection:**
1. Count classes manually (10 min)
2. Count properties manually (10 min)
3. Check each variant (5 min)
4. Review recent commits (5 min)
5. Calculate growth (10 min)
6. Assess health manually (15 min)
**Total: ~55 minutes**

**With /stats:**
1. Run command
2. Review output
**Total: ~2 minutes**

**Saves: 53 minutes (96% reduction)**
