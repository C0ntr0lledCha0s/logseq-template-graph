# Claude Code Optimization Plan
## Logseq Template Graph - Enhancement Recommendations

**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** November 2025
**Priority:** High Impact Features First

---

## Executive Summary

This project is **perfectly suited** for Claude Code optimizations. Current automation (npm scripts, Babashka, GitHub Actions) is strong, but developer experience can be dramatically improved with:

- **10 Slash Commands** - Quick access to common workflows
- **3 Specialized Agents** - Complex multi-step automation
- **3 Git Hooks** - Passive validation and safety
- **3 Custom Skills** - Domain-specific analysis

**Expected Impact:**
- 30-40 min saved per developer/week (Phase 1)
- 120+ min saved per developer/week (Full implementation)
- **Payback period: 2-3 weeks**

  place, product, intangible, action

⚠️  Attention Needed (3/11)

  misc/ - 82 classes, 59 properties
    Status: BLOATED (61% of all classes)
    Suggestion: Split into sub-modules:
      - communication/ (EmailMessage, Message, etc.)
      - medical/ (MedicalCondition, Drug, etc.)
      - financial/ (Invoice, PaymentCard, etc.)

  common/ - 0 classes, 189 properties
    Status: OK (shared properties across modules)
    Note: High reuse rate (good architecture)

  health/ - varies
    Status: INCOMPLETE
    Suggestion: Complete health module or merge into misc/

💡 Recommendations:
  1. Split misc/ into 5 focused modules
  2. Move health properties to dedicated module
  3. Consider adding financial/ module
