It is common for distributions of software and data to be based on \"upstream\" sources. When [maintainer](https://schema.org/maintainer) is applied to a specific version of something e.g. a particular version or packaging of a [Dataset](https://schema.org/Dataset), it is always possible that the upstream source has a different maintainer. The [isBasedOn](https://schema.org/isBasedOn) property can be used to indicate such relationships between datasets to make the different maintenance roles clear. Similarly in the case of software, a package may have dedicated maintainers working on integration into software distributions such as Ubuntu, as well as upstream maintainers of the underlying work."}},
